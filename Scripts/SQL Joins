Use inner join to connect the contents of three tables and identify top revenue-generating countries

SELECT A. country,
COUNT (D.customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM country A
INNER JOIN city B on A. country_id = B. country_id
INNER JOIN address C on C. city_id = B. city_id
INNER JOIN customer D on D. address_id = C. address_id
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
